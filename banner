                            welcome to the wppnx tilde/pubnix

This is hosted on a raspberry pi zero w, so i guess you could call it
a dedi :)

if you are wondering what the (pink) rectange in the logo is, it is
the case of the pi zero, since that was the only color the rockville
science center had in their 3d printer lol

there is not much here at the moment, but feel free to create things
or suggest programs to be installed!

to save your session, both tmux and byobu are installed

to share text with people, go on the irc server (localhost). irssi and weechat
are installed, but request your preferred client to be installed.
or use mutt (neomutt) to send local emails (username@wppnx)
